# Contributing to ResBazAZ

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Research Bazaar Arizona (ResBazAZ) :tada:! 

ResBazAZ is a group of people with diverse backgrounds and expertise who come together to do research. We are students, post-docs, faculty, researchers, and more. Our goal is to expand collaborations beyond a departmental level. Thanks to our community, researchers from entirely different backgrounds become acquaintance and learn from each other!

So how do you get involved? There are several ways!

* Bring your research project to any ResBazAZ event and ask for help!
* Offer to help others with their research project at any ResBazAZ event.
* Help ResBazAZ develop our own resources and reach out to other researchers
